    "So far, in ME480, we have rarely discussed what happens to a system when we apply inputs other than constant (step) changes. However, many systems (both open loop and controlled systems) have to react to other types of inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a system is subjected to a \"shock\" type input, we might use an impulse input $U(s) = U$ to study its reaction. As another example, we can study how a system might react to a ramp input, for example, by using the laplace tranform and applying $U(s) = \\frac{U}{s^2}$. We could look at the system's steady state value for a ramp input (if it has one) or we could simulate how its output might evolve over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But these inputs aren't the only types of inputs we can study! There are many systems that need to react to **periodic** inputs as well! As an example, consider the simulation below of the \"glass grab\" system, but with a glass angle that varies sinusoidally. This could be used to simulate trying to grab a glass while on a moving ship, as an example."

    "## How do we *characterize* a system's response to a sinusoidal input?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been relying on the Laplace transform fairly heavily this semester. Remember that when we look at a system transfer function in the Laplace domain, we have a complete picture of how that system would respond to any type of input. This is true whether we're talking about the transient portion of the system response, or its steady-state response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mostly, we've been focusing on system performance (in either closed loop or open loop) in terms of its step response. From a system's step response, we can evaluate properties of the system's behavior like damping ratio, natural frequency, percent overshoot, rise time, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in many cases instances, either a physical system we encounter or a control system we design might have to deal with steady-state, sinusoidal inputs. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* an RC filter we might design to filter out noise on an AC electrical line (which is a sinusoid at approximately $60Hz$) to improve control system performance\n",
    "* a car suspension designed to filter out \"washboard\" bumps in a road\n",
    "* an autonomous car's path-following controller, which may have to follow a winding road\n",
    "* an active or passive vibration attenuation system on a piece of rotating machinery\n",
    "* a control system that needs to change direction quickly, such as a CNC machine, 3D printer head, or bipedal robot balancing system\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, a step response (or other time-domain) test or design criterion might be useful, but does not give us direct information about how the system would perform if subjected to a sinusoidal input for a long period of time."

    "In this example, the input frequency was $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians per second, or $\\frac{1}{4}Hz$. This means that one cycle took $4s$ to complete. We call this the *period* $T$ of the sine wave signal. Each full cycle of a sine wave encompasses $2\\pi$ radians.

    "This paradigm of looking at how a system responds to sinusoidal inputs is useful for both the design of a physical system like a filter to *reject* sinusoidal inputs at a certain frequency, and for the design of control systems that might need to *track* sinusoidal inputs of a certain frequency. The magnitude ratio is particularly important for assessing how a system responds to a sine wave input, and the target magnitude ratio for a system depends on what the system is supposed to do. If our goal was for perfect tracking of an input of a particular frequency in the design of a control system, our closed loop system $G_{cl}$ should have a *magnitude ratio* of close to 1 for that frequency, but if our goal was to design a filter, we'd want our filter transfer function to have a *small* magnitude ratio, so that the system doesn't respond to, or \"rejects\", inputs of a certain frequency.\n"

What we found by looking at the plot of the output \"data\" (from MATLAB's simulation of the response) was that we had a magnitude ratio of $MR=0.53$ and a phase lag of $57.5^\\circ \\approx 1\\:rad$. Let's see if we can reproduce those results using the method presented above.\n",
